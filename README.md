# Market Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model to predict market prices based on historical data.  
The model uses a sliding window approach to train on sequences of time-series values and forecast future trends.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of financial time-series data
- Creation of supervised learning datasets from raw sequences
- LSTM model architecture for sequential forecasting
- Training and evaluation pipeline
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras

## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/market_prediction.git
cd market_prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
